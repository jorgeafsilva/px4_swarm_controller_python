## Introduction

This Python package provides a template for implementing swarm controllers within a Gazebo simulation environment integrated with PX4 and ROS2. It is based on [px4_swarm_controller](https://github.com/PX4/px4_swarm_controller) with several modifications—some functionalities have been changed and new features added—to better suit your swarm experimentation needs.

## Features

- **Swarm Control Template:** A starting point to design and test swarm algorithms.
- **Gazebo Integration:** Seamless simulation within a Gazebo environment.
- **PX4 Compatibility:** Works with the PX4 flight stack configured for ROS2.
- **ROS2 Communication:** Utilizes ROS2 nodes for command and telemetry exchange.

## Prerequisites

- **PX4 with ROS2 Integration:**  
  Follow the PX4 ROS2 Communication guide for setup instructions:  
  [PX4 ROS2 Communication Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/ros2_comm.html)

- **ROS2 Humble Hawksbill:**  
  If ROS2 Humble is not installed, refer to the [ROS2 Humble Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).

## Installation

1. **Clone this Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set Up PX4 with ROS2:**  
   Follow the instructions provided in the [PX4 ROS2 Communication Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/ros2_comm.html) to download and configure PX4 for ROS2.

3. **Install ROS2 Humble (if not already installed):**  
   Follow the steps in the [ROS2 Humble Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).

4. **Prepare the Repository Structure:**  
   If your project requires it, move the `custom_msgs` folder out of the initial folder. For example:

   ```bash
   mv custom_msgs ../custom_msgs
   ```

5. **Build the Package:**  
   Assuming you have a ROS2 workspace (or create one):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cp -r your-repo ~/ros2_ws/src/
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```

   Then source the workspace:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

- **Launching the Swarm Controller Node:**

  Once the build is complete, run the controller node with:

  ```bash
  ros2 run your_package_name swarm_controller
  ```

- **Running the Simulation:**

  Ensure that your Gazebo simulation environment is running with PX4 configured for ROS2. Then launch your swarm controller node to see it communicate with the simulated PX4 system.

## Customization

- **Controller Logic:**  
  Modify the Python scripts in the package to implement your custom swarm algorithms.

- **Integration:**  
  You can extend the package by adding new ROS2 nodes or modifying existing messages to suit your application.

- **Simulation Parameters:**  
  Adjust Gazebo and PX4 parameters to match your simulation requirements.
